#### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a research assistant at [the CSE department of Sharif University of Technology (SUT)](http://ce.sharif.edu/), working under the supervision of Professor [Maziar Goudarzi](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/maziargoudarzi), where I collaborate on different projects which are related to my areas of expertise.

Here is [my personal webpage](https://nrasadi.github.io)!

âœ¨ All kinds of research collaboration are always appreciated, especially those having positive social impact. However, I only contribute if it follows open-source code and public data sharing policies.
