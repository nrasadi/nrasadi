#### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a research assistant at [the CSE department of Sharif University of Technology (SUT)](http://ce.sharif.edu/), working under the supervision of Professor [Maziar Goudarzi](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/maziargoudarzi), where I collaborate on different projects which are related to my areas of expertise.
